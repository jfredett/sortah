#Version rules

Version 1.0 comes when I'm pretty sure there are no major outstanding bugs from
release. After that, SemVer applies.

Let me (jfredett) control the Version, please don't submit a version change in
any pull request. This is merely out of concern for sanity.

#Contribution

Easy peasy, fork, pull request. Don't submit something with broken tests in it. 

If you find a bug, filing an issue is cool, fixing it is cooler. I will love you
forever if you fix it. 

##Contributing sortah definitions:

For now, there is no "sortah contrib" repo, if there are many people interested
in sharing some common set of sortah definitions, then one will be created.

For now, if you have something cool, make a page in the wiki.
